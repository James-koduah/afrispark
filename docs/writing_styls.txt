For a website about African innovators and their innovations, a combination of friendly and conversational, educational and informative, 
and inspirational and motivational styles could work well. Here's why:

Friendly and Conversational:
This style will help you connect with your readers on a personal level. It makes the content approachable and encourages readers to feel
like they're having a conversation with a friend. Given the positive and inspiring nature of the content (highlighting innovators and their achievements), 
a friendly tone can enhance engagement.

Educational and Informative:
As your website aims to showcase the achievements and innovations of African personalities, an educational and informative style is crucial.
Clearly conveying information about the innovators, their background, and the impact of their innovations will be appreciated by your audience.

Inspirational and Motivational:
Highlighting the stories of African innovators inherently carries an inspirational and motivational aspect. This style will help instill a sense of pride, 
encouragement, and optimism among your readers, inspiring them to appreciate and perhaps even contribute to the innovation landscape in Africa.

Remember to adapt your writing style based on the specific content of each blog post. For example, a profile of a young innovator might benefit from a more 
conversational and motivational tone, while a post about a groundbreaking technology might lean towards an educational and informative style. This approach 
allows you to maintain a consistent brand voice while tailoring your communication to the uniqueness of each innovator's story.
